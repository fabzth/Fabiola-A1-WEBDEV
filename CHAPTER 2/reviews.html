            <li>101 Dalmations is a fantastic film with excellent characters, and after watching it one would think that it cannot be depicted in live action. The live action remakes proved this correct, however Cruella is different.
                The angle taken on the film actually provides a sufficient and imaginative backstory for Cruella DeVil, and it cleverly manages to position the audiences on the side of the character despite how much we hate her in all her other depictions. That was quite impressive, as well as the acting from Emma Thompson.
                The story was good, except there appeared to be repetition of segments of the movie which just make you feel like the movie is more of the way through than it actually is. Another thing that did this was the constant climactic moments which end up tiring you out a little. This means that when the proper climax happens, the movie feels like it's been going on forever and you find yourself not really as engaged as you should be.
                Emma Stone's accent was really impressive, however it must have been the director's decision to make it more posh in certain moments, which I wasn't really a fan of. Also, the incorporation of a full fledged lgbt character felt a little unsuitable for the time period in which it was set (sorry about the spoiler).
                The soundtrack was filled with excellent songs which were really suitable for the film. However, the events happening on screen couldn't quite match the coolness of the song resulting in the music being a slight distraction.
                Overall a very admirable and imaginative effort from Disney.

                I stereotyped it before I even saw it. Starting it I was like ok this is the Devil Wears Prada...right? 
                It had more story than I expected, more beauty than I expected, more subtlety than I expected and I knew I loved this movie when I knew I loved Wink the Dog. 
                I thought all the actors did a great job. I was impressed at the actor that played Horace.....is that name right? 
                Last I had seen him in was Richard Jewell which was so serious but in this movie he had more comic talent than I expected from him. I had never heard the song from Iggy Pop before but now I find myself singing it. 
                I loved loved this movie. I'm excited to watch it over and over again

                When I heard that they we're going to make a live-action movie about Cruella de Vil, I thought: This is going to be a disaster.
                The trailers looked good but still not really great.
                This movie? Blows every live action (except Cinderella) out of the park! Cruella is brilliantly written, acted and portrayed. All the side characters are memorable and useful. The baroness is amazing and just pure evil. I love it.
                The costume designs are the best thing in this movie. They are beautiful, diffrent and are a feast to your eyes.
                This movie gives me hope for the future of Disney!
